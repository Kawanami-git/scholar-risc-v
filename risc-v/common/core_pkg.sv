\brief      Core-wide parameters and control encodings for scholar risc-v
\author     Kawanami
\date       16/05/2026
\version    1.1

\details
  Centralizes architectural widths (XLEN/ADDR/DATA), register-file sizing,
  and all micro-op/control encodings used across the core:
  - Execution unit control (EXE_*),
  - Program counter control (PC_*),
  - Memory access control (MEM_*),
  - GPR/CSR write-back control (GPR_*, CSR_*),
  - Bypass control,
  - Base instruction opcode tags (LOAD_OP, REG_OP, SYS_OP, ...).

  XLEN-dependent constants are selected via preprocessor defines
  (e.g., XLEN64 vs default RV32).

\remarks
  - Keep these encodings in sync with decode/execute/Mem/Writeback logic.
  - Changing widths or encodings here impacts multiple stages
    (decode tables, hazard logic, memory formatting, etc.).
