\brief      scholar risc-v core fetch module
\author     Kawanami
\date       29/03/2026
\version    1.3

\details
  This module implements the instruction fetch unit
  of the scholar risc-v core.

  It retrieves the instruction located at
  `pc_next_i` via the memory interface.
  The instruction data is provided by `rdata_i`
  and is considered valid when `rvalid_i` is high.

  As this is a single-cycle processor, instruction fetch
  and execution occur in the same cycle.
  Therefore, a new instruction must be fetched at every clock cycle.

  For memory-dependent operations (e.g., load/store),
  which require two cycles to be processed,
  it is essential that `pc_next_i` remains stable
  while the instruction completes to avoid fetching incorrect data.

  This fetch unit forms the entry point of the core pipeline,
  providing a steady flow of valid instructions to the decode unit.

\remarks
  - This implementation complies with [reference or standard].
  - TODO: [possible improvements or future features]

  * For instructions that take more than one cycle to complete
  * (e.g., memory accesses), the `pc_next_i` must remain stable
